The 'mandatory' first project: Hello World for Git

My name is James Roberts. I am finishing my Associates degree in Computer information Systems: Web Development & Design. The technology stack I've been learning in university as well as on my own is:

Linux (Bash)
HTML5
XML
CSS3/Saas
JavaScript
Node (Still very new)
jQuery
PHP
SQL (Focus on MySQL)
GIMP

my first web project was my Churches website:
http://stpaulsalbanyny.com/

I developed and designed the site.
When I'm not coding I like to spend my time with my wife, and son. 

I'm based out of the Capital District of New York State.
